# ML-algorithms
Implementations of ML-algos as I learn them

I learning the math and theory behind some of the common ML algorithms
Initially my plan is to implement those algorithms from scratch as I not very comfortable with Python.This serves to get myself comfortable with Python.Overtime I plan to learn the various ML frameworks
and would then add library based implementation as and when I implement them
