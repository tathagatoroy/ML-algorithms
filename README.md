# ML-algorithms
Implementations of ML-algos as I learn them

I learning the math and theory behind some of the common ML algorithms


Initially my plan is to implement those algorithms from scratch as I am not very comfortable with Python.This serves to get myself comfortable with Python.Overtime I plan to learn the various ML frameworks
and would then add library based implementation as and when I implement them.

## Todo 
Add Graphs and images to see how the models work while tinkering with the parameters of the models

Making the implementations more general so as reduce the number of assumptions I made in the implementation.This would allow the code to be reused in later projects
